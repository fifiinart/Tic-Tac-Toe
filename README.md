# Tic-Tac-Toe

Hello! This is a little project for creating in online Tic-Tac-Toe game using `p5.js`.

This is not finished yet, but you can play what exists [here](https://fifiinart.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/):

Planned changes:

* Actually playing the game
* 2-player support
* AI for one-player

If you have any questions or concerns, you can say so at my [Discord Developer Server](https://discord.gg/JTB4Cq4).
